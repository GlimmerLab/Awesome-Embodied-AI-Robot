This repository collects research resources in the field of Embodied AI, including papers, code implementations, and datasets. Embodied AI studies how robots can learn and accomplish tasks through interaction with the environment, which is an important intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics.

## Domain Relationships

Embodied AI research involves multiple interconnected domains:

- **Fundamental Theory**: Provides theoretical foundations for embodied AI, including cognitive science and control theory
- **Robot Learning & Reinforcement Learning**: Enables autonomous learning and decision-making capabilities for robots
- **Environment Perception**: Enables robots to understand and adapt to their environment, including visual language understanding
- **Motion Planning & Task Planning**: Implements robot action execution and task decomposition
- **Multimodal Interaction**: Supports multimodal interaction between robots and environment/humans
- **Simulation Platforms**: Provides virtual environments for robot learning and testing
